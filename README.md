# Boston Housing Price Analysis

## Context
This project was developed as part of a **group assignment** in the course **Principles of Data Science**.
The project focuses on exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling using the Boston Housing dataset.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and visualize housing data and build a predictive model to estimate housing prices using linear regression.

## Dataset
The Boston Housing dataset contains information about housing characteristics, including:
- Crime rate
- Average number of rooms
- Property tax rate
- Accessibility to highways
- Median value of owner-occupied homes
The dataset is provided in Excel format and was used as input for the analysis.

## Methodology
- Data import and preprocessing
- Data visualization and summarization
- Shuffling and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Building a linear regression model
- Evaluating model performance on the test dataset

## Tools and Technologies
- Altair AI Studio (RapidMiner)

## Results
The project resulted in:
- Visual insights into housing data
- A trained linear regression model
- Performance evaluation of the predictive model

## Files in This Repository
- `Boston Housing Dataset.xls` – Dataset used for the analysis  
- `Boston Housing Dataset.rmp` – RapidMiner process file containing the analytical workflow  

## How to Run
Open the `.rmp` file using **Altair AI Studio (RapidMiner)** and execute the process to reproduce the analysis and results.
